# cuistot-Project

This project is the first group project of my formation at Wild Code School.
During two weeks we worked as a team of 5, in order to create our first website.
We used basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript we just learned during the first weeks of the formation.

The subject was free, we chose to create a website which is is a catalog of french reciepes sorted by regions.
It is developped Mobile first, and adaptive to Desktop version.

Bon appÃ©tit !
